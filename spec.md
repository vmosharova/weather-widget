**Goal:**  
Build a weather widget for a hallway monitor display, focused on **data density and clarity**.

**Location:**  
Berlin, Germany

**Data Source:**  
Use the **BrightSky API** to fetch weather data. Refresh every **10 minutes** or **on demand**.

**Display Requirements:**  
- **Current temperature**, prominently displayed  
- **Current weather icon** (e.g., sun, cloud, rain)  
- **Precipitation:** chance (%) and total (mm)  
- **Cloud coverage** (%)  
- **3-day temperature graph:**  
  - Line or area chart  
  - Show **highs and lows** over time, labeled directly on the graph  
  - Use time axis to show day/night cycles if useful

**Design Style:**  
- Prioritize **information density** and legibility  
- Suitable for passive glance in a hallway  
- Visual inspiration: **Deutsche Wetterdienst**, **Dark Sky**, and similar data-driven apps

**Other Notes:**  
- Layout should scale reasonably to different screen resolutions (but primarily optimized for large displays)  
- Prefer modern JS/React or HTML/CSS/vanilla JS stack  
- Code modularity and clarity are a priority for future extensibility
